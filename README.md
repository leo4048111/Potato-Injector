**Basic Menu Layout & Explained**
## Build Prerequisites
+ Installed Microsoft Visual Studio 2019+ 
+ Installed [DirectX Software Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
+ [BlackBone Static Library](https://github.com/DarthTon/Blackbone), build the project into `BlackBone.lib`(Release build) and `BlackBone-d.lib`(Debug build)
+ Put both .lib files under `$(ProjectDir)\dependency\blackbone\Lib`
## How this injector works?
+ This injector uses `blackbone::Process::mmap().MapImage`(which is a widely used manual map implementation) to map dll into target process memory.
+ For safety concerns, you can also optionally choose to patch vac3_bypass.hpp(which is another dll dumped to bytecode) into steam before injecting your own dll. This vac3_bypass will disable any steam verification routines so your module stays undetected when game runs.
## How to use?
+ Click `Patch VAC3`, then steam will close then automatically open.
+ Put all .dll files in `dlls` folder(automatically created).
+ Select the dll to inject, make sure CSGO game is up and running, then click `inject` to start injection.
+ Other labels and controls should be straightforward enough to comprehend.

## Notice
+ ***Use this injector at your own risk.***
+ ***You can optionally change vac3_bypass/vac3_bypass.hpp to your own vac3 bypass method, the one in this project has been deprecated and is risky to use***
+ ***Due to my current workload, I haven't been able to actively maintain this injector lately. Would greatly appreciate any PRs for bug fixes or new features. Contributors are more than welcome!***
## Update
+ Compatibility updates, now works on CS2 smoothly...
+ For legacy CS:GO version, get it from Release v1.0 Executable(For CS:GO)
+ Added custom process selection in v3.0
